Overview

An 8-to-3 encoder is a combinational logic circuit that converts eight distinct input lines (d0–d7) into a 3-bit binary output (q2, q1, q0). Only one input is expected to be active at a time. The output represents the binary code corresponding to the active input line. This circuit performs the reverse operation of a decoder.

Working Principle

Inputs: d0, d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7

Outputs: q2, q1, q0

Rule: For any single active input, the output generates its equivalent binary code.

For example:

If d0 = 1 → Output = 000

If d3 = 1 → Output = 011

If d7 = 1 → Output = 111

This greatly reduces the number of data lines needed in a circuit, making the design efficient and scalable.

Boolean Equations

From the truth table, the output functions are:

q0 = d1 + d3 + d5 + d7

q1 = d2 + d3 + d6 + d7

q2 = d4 + d5 + d6 + d7

Here + denotes the OR operation.

Circuit Diagram

The encoder can be built using OR gates.

q0 uses 4-input OR gate with d1, d3, d5, d7.

q1 uses 4-input OR gate with d2, d3, d6, d7.

q2 uses 4-input OR gate with d4, d5, d6, d7.





Applications

Microprocessors: To encode multiple interrupt requests into fewer lines.

Data Compression: Used in communication to reduce multiple inputs into compact form.

Digital Systems: Efficiently representing large numbers of signals with fewer outputs.

Keyboards and Input Devices: Encoding multiple keypresses into binary codes.

Priority Encoders: Extensions of encoders that resolve conflicts when multiple inputs are active.

Advantages

Reduces the number of data lines.

Simplifies circuit design.

Efficient for transmitting and processing information.

Limitations

Only one input should be active at a time; otherwise, outputs are undefined.

Requires a priority encoder in cases where multiple inputs may become active simultaneously.
